The entertainment streaming industry has undergone a transformative shift in how content is discovered and consumed. With Netflix hosting over 8,800 titles spanning diverse genres, languages, and cultures, users face the paradox of choice – an overwhelming catalog that can hinder rather than enhance the viewing experience. Industry research indicates that effective recommendation systems contribute to 80% of content watched on streaming platforms, directly influencing user engagement, subscription retention, and platform revenue.

Traditional content discovery methods, such as manual browsing or simple genre categorization, fail to capture the nuanced preferences of modern viewers. Users seek personalized experiences that align with their tastes, viewing history, and contextual preferences. This challenge presents a significant opportunity for data science applications in content recommendation.

Primary Challenge: How can we leverage content metadata to build an intelligent recommendation system that accurately predicts content similarity and provides meaningful suggestions to users?

This project implements a content-based filtering approach using advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Unlike collaborative filtering that requires user interaction history, content-based systems analyze intrinsic content characteristics – genres, cast, directors, plot descriptions – to identify similarities and generate recommendations.
